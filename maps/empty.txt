# you can make maps by adding rects
# each line is 1 rect
# a rect has 5 params:
#   abs x1 y1 x2 y2
# 
# or you can use a width/height rect:
#   wh x1 y1 width height
#
#
# finally, add ' | ' after the rect and then add 3 more params for red, green, blue
#
# examples:
#
# 10x10 green rect starting at (5,5):
# 	wh 5 5 10 10 | 0 255 0
#
#
# (2,3,10,11) blue rect:
#	abs 2 3 10 11 | 5 5 255
