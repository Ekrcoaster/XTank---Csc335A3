# Welcome to XTank!
Run **Boot.java** and then choose how you want to play the game. You can create a server, join a server, or both!
Afterwards, you can choose your tanks and other players can join in, then you will be taken to the battlefield. After all but 1 player has been killed, the results screen will pop up and from there you can replay, return to title, or exit the game entirely.
